Hi there -

This is a contract for creating a webpage for a provided topic. The webpage should require ~5 hours of work.

Critical requirements:
Complete the project until the contract due date. Send us html files of the website. Do your own research for content.

If you can’t do the above please do not accept the project.

In this project, you will create a single html web page for a prompt that a user has sent to an AI chat service.

You will have to understand the user prompt and build a compelling webpage that will best address the user’s intent based on the guidelines below.

You may use any tool you normally use to achieve this goal, including image editing software, google search, ai models for research, ai code assistants, etc. You can use AI generated text and images.

Important: make sure to not include any copyrighted content (e.g. images) - only include public domain or AI generated content.

In many cases, the user prompts may be ambiguous and not clear. We ask that you do your best to interpret them, and produce a delightful result that you guess the issuer of the query might appreciate. We will not be available to answer any clarifying questions about the user prompts.

Please create a page for the following user prompt:
Topic63: Hi, what is a good recipe for a potato soup?

Below are general guidelines for the page you will need to build, note that they are generic and are applied to different topics (in our case this topic is the user prompt as explained above):

Goal
==========
For your topic, you should create a highly interactive, single-page website. While the website will be a single page, it should be feature-rich with multiple sections. Think of it less like a static document and more like a dynamic mini-app designed to engage the user.

Content and Research
=================
Research and Write: You are responsible for thoroughly researching the topic online and writing all the content. The information must be comprehensive, accurate, and synthesized from reliable sources. You may use Google or AI tools to research and summarize the topic.

Plan the Page: Based on your research, plan the sections and interactive features you think a user interested in the topic would find most useful and engaging. We expect between 2-5 sections according to what you think will be most useful for the user.

Design and Functionality
===================
Interactive First: Prioritize interactivity. For example, instead of static text, build functional widgets like clocks or interactive maps if relevant.

Prefer Visuals Over Text: Avoid "walls of text." Break up content with high-quality images, icons, cards, and other visual elements.

Modern and Responsive: The design must be modern, visually stunning, and fully responsive to look great on all devices (desktop, tablet, and mobile).

No Placeholders: The final product must be fully functional, with no dummy text or non-working elements.

Final Delivery:
===========
Please send a single zip file with the webpage folder you created. The folder name should be the exact topic number that you received in your guidelines (For example: a folder named ‘‘Topic63’’). The folder should contain a file named ‘‘Index.html’’ that should contain all the js, css and html for the webpage. You may use external libraries and apis like tailwind, google maps apis, or various fonts / icons. Other than index.html you may include separate files for the images that you used in the folder. Please make sure that the webpage works as intended before you submit.
